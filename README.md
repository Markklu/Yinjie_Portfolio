# [Project 1: State Estimation and Localization for Self-driving cars](https://github.com/Markklu/State-Estimation-AV)
* Implemented Error State - Extended Kalman Filter to predict and correct state estimation.
* Used provided true ground path of the vehicle as comparison.
* Implemented sensor fusion algorithm including: GNSS, IMU, LIDAR.
* Successfully track the true ground path and tested robustness for sensor malfunction cases.
